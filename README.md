# Algorithms-Implementations
Some interesting algorithms implementations in java programming language.

First example about mergesort implementation with counting the cost for every inversion(every inversion has specific cost)

Second example about coin change algorithm for limited and non limited number of coins(in my case i use boxes that should be loaded in a container).
